Hi, for QualityScaler to work properly you need to download and put the AI models files in this folder (i am not able to make them already available because they are too heavy and github does not accept them).

There are 2 ways:
- contact me on Telegram (https://linktr.ee/j3ngystudio) and I will arrange to send the AIs 
- download the individual files from all the github defined in the CREDITS section, and slightly change the names of the models equal to the AI models list in QualityScaler
